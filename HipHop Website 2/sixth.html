   <p>Released just over a year after his debut record, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 is Jay’s sophomore album,
     and although it had more successful than his debut in terms of sales (138k first week vs 43k),
     it was met with a lot criticism. Although much of the Mafioso theme that ran through Reasonable Doubt remains,
     Jay added a touch of commercial style due working with high profile collaborations with Diddy and Trackmasters.
     The album was criticised for taking a more radio-friendly approach, and tracks like “Sunshine,”. Over the years,
     Jay has claimed that Vol. 1 could have been “a classic,” if he hadn’t chased radio airplay."What I did with ‘[In My Lifetime] Volume One’ was I tried to make records.
     I had just made ‘Reasonable Doubt’ … it wasn’t successful in music industry terms,
     it was a cult classic on the streets, but it wasn’t successful in the music business and I tried to blend the two.
     If you look back on ‘In My Lifetime,’ there were songs on there that were brilliant. I don’t listen to that album because I think I messed it up.
     It’s so many incredible records on there that I think I missed having two classics in a row [by] trying to get on the radio".
