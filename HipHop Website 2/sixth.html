   <p>Released just over a year after his debut record, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 is Jay’s sophomore album,
     and although it had more successful than his debut in terms of sales (138k first week vs 43k),
     it was met with a lot criticism. Although much of the Mafioso theme that ran through Reasonable Doubt remains,
     Jay added a touch of commercial style due working with high profile collaborations with Diddy and Trackmasters.
     The album was criticised for taking a more radio-friendly approach, and tracks like “Sunshine,”. Over the years,
     Jay has claimed that Vol. 1 could have been “a classic,” if he hadn’t chased radio airplay."What I did with ‘[In My Lifetime] Volume One’ was I tried to make records.
     I had just made ‘Reasonable Doubt’ … it wasn’t successful in music industry terms,
     it was a cult classic on the streets, but it wasn’t successful in the music business and I tried to blend the two.
     If you look back on ‘In My Lifetime,’ there were songs on there that were brilliant. I don’t listen to that album because I think I messed it up.
     It’s so many incredible records on there that I think I missed having two classics in a row [by] trying to get on the radio".

     <p> August 11th, 1973 was the day that HipHop was born. In New York City where it would go to heights which did not seem possible or unrealistic in its early days.
       It mixed elements such as Jazz, Reggae, Disco and many more. In the late 80’s it was heavy on Afrocentrism and political messages and views.
       The 90s came round birth artists which would have a heavy influence on the game and to the masses such as Nas, Biggie, Tupac and many more. Many consider the 90s the Golden age in HipHop.
       In current times HipHop heads feels like HipHop is doing the opposite of evolving and going backwards due to the material which is being put out.
       There’s now a thing called “Mumble rappers” and people give a lot of criticism to them due to the poor quality of music being produced and not elevating HipHop as it should be.

       <h3>Rappers who tried to leave their bad record deals</h3>
       <p> Hip-Hop has become a big business and has benefited a number of artists, producing multiple multi-millionaires and becoming an economy in itself. However, along with that success has come greed, financial impropriety, and other unsavoury tactics and traits deployed by the very corporations and companies that profit off the music. This has resulted in a number of rap artists and producers getting the short end of the stick in terms of compensation for their work. Rap earliest pioneers have fallen victim to these types of shady contracts. Despite their effort for the label and what their music has done for their company and brand.</p>

<p>Lil Wayne had issue with Cash Money. After rumours of tension between the two bubbled to the surface in 2014, Lil Wayne filed a $51 million lawsuit against Birdman and Cash Money, accusing the CEO of violating the terms of his contract by withholding his 12th solo studio album, Tha Carter V. In September 2016, Weezy accused Birdman of taking the majority of the $100 million advance UMG had initially given to Young Money for himself, which resulted in a judge ordering Birdman to detail exactly how he spent his portion of the advance later that same month. On July 5, 2017, Lil Wayne filed an amended petition in a New Orleans court, seeking over $40 million in damages amid claims that Birdman, Ronald “Slim” Williams, and Universal Music Group didn’t pay him the $8 million advance owed for Tha Carter V. Ultimately, the cold war would end in June 2018, when Birdman granted Lil Wayne a release from his contract in a settlement worth upwards of $10 million.</p>
<br /><br  />
<p>Mase and Bad Boy Records. Mase’s abrupt retirement from rap following the release of his second studio album, Double Up, in 1999, and his eventual return five years later with Welcome Back, was one of the most intriguing story-lines in hip-hop history. Following Welcome Back’s release, Mase, who had signed his deal with Bad Boy in 1996, sought to leave the label and join 50 Cent’s G-Unit Records roster in 2005. However, Diddy, who was seeking a buyout of Mase’s contract, reportedly had a price in mind that was too steep for Fif, who later balked at the notion of paying $2 million to acquire the Harlem World rapper’s services. In late January, 2020, Mase responded to Diddy’s speech at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy gala, which saw him taking the Recording Academy to task for its treatment of black musical artists and producers by criticizing Diddy’s own business tactics, including his refusal to sell Mase back his publishing, which Diddy allegedly purchased for $20,000. “You bought it for about 20k & I offered you 2m in cash, Mase wrote in an lengthy Instagram post. “This is not black excellence at all.” Diddy has yet to respond to Mase’s comments as of press time.</p>
<br /><br  />
<p>In 1985, Salt-N-Pepa—on the verge of becoming one of hip-hop’s marquee acts—signed a contract with Next Plateau Records that granted their manager Herby Luv Bug half of a $5 million check for production costs, while the group’s three members split the remainder. Herby was initially receiving 100 percent of the group’s royalties until they renegotiated years later. A decade later, TLC infamously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy—just after the release of 1994’s diamond-certified classic CrazySexyCool—due to a shitty 360 deal they signed with LaFace Records and the production/management company Pebbitone.</p>
